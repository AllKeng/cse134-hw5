# Portfolio Enhancements  

For this update, I made several improvements to my portfolio project:  
1. **Refactored fancy-card to project-card template** 
2. **Allowed capability of loading in projects from cloud/database** 
    * Both allow me to add more projects easier
    * More portability and convenience

3. **Added <ins>Asteroid Classification Project</ins> to Projects List** 
4. **Added <ins>Education</ins> section to Resume**
    * Both provide more insights about what I have learned and interacted with.
    * Make my portfolio slightly more stronger

5. **Wrote some file headers for my scripts** 
    * Explains/Summarizes the purpose of each javascript script if needed to later refactor or improve.
    * Having documentation is generally just nice to have. 

6. **Made header and footer attached to the top and bottom respectively** 
    * May be personal, but seeing the white space around the header and footer bothered me. So I got rid of the white space there.
    * Very much so subjective
    * I feel it is also slightly more convenient to the user to navigate.

7. **UI Enhancements** 
    * Made some buttons and texts larger so they are easier to see and interact with.
    * Ensured the hamburger menu is more visible for smaller screens especially when toggling dark and light mode.
